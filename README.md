# NetBitz Weaver

NetBitz Weaver was intended to be "An advanced .NET protector".

However, I ended up abandoning the project, and consequently decided to publish the source in case someone else might want the code.

If you need this code under a different license, post an issue.

NBW is powered by `dnlib`, the powerful assembly editor.
